This project presents a portable air quality monitoring system for bicycles. It measures PM2.5 and PM10 in real time and transmits the data via LoRaWAN, helping cyclists choose healthier routes based on current pollution levels.

This project was originally developed as part of a master's thesis at **HTW Berlin (University of Applied Sciences)** in 2025.
